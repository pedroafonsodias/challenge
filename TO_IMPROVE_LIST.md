### Points to improve in order to be a production ready

* Add security layer
* Add a multithreading test 
* Add more tests in order to test all combinations
* Add integration tests
* I do miss a yaml file describing the rest endpoint
* also we should expose the heath endpoint in order to automate the health status of this endpoint
* We also should configure the CORS allowed origins
* We should also consider using some mechanism to protect against CSRF attacks
